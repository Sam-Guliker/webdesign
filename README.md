# User: 
Everything Web students.

# User Scenario
I want to make sure that topics of principles of user interface  
design are clear to students of the everything web minor, the principles   
do not remain vague.

# Testing
I've tested with my minor students.

* Jamie
* Kevin
* Vincent
* Chana

## Test results
### Jamie
> Make the text lines smaller and maybe you can put it next to each other.  -Jamie

What he means by this is to go from one column to  
two column, so you can create more space for the content and  
make the text more readable.

### Kevin
> The website list feels "choppie". Kevin

This is due to the margins that have to be adjusted and there is no animation on the content block.

### Vincent
> EImage only examples do not work properly.

Vincent is right, it is handy to add a description.

### Feedback
* [x] Make a two column layout when you open the content.
* [x] Give consistent marigins.
* [x] Make sure the examples are also having a  description.

# Principles of User Interface Design
During the design and construction of the website, I applied several principles.  
The principles are intended to help the user on the website.

## 2. Interfaces exist to enable interaction
I make sure that the user can use simple interaction to get more information about the topics.

## 3. Conserve attention at all costs
There is no distraction in the application the user can go through  
the application without being disturbed.

## 10. Consistency matters
The padding, margin, color, font colour, images are equal or have the  
same size, making the website look peaceful.

## 11. Strong visual hierarchies work best
Through the layout and font size, the user is easily guided through the web page.

## 13. Highlight don’t determine with color

## 14. Progressive Disclosure
