# Webdesign
For this topic I have to look at who the users are and create an exclusive website for them.

# Users: 
Larissa
Everything Web studenten.

# User Scenarios
* Larissa has a limited vision, in order to build a good website for her the website must be well structured.
* I want to make sure that topics of principles of user interface design are clear to students of the everything web minor and do not remain vague.

# Testing
I've tested with my minor students.

* Jamie
* Kevin
* Vincent
* Chana

## Test results
### Jamie
> Make the text lines smaller and maybe you can put it next to each other.  -Jamie

What he means by this is to go from one column to  
two column, so you can create more space for the content and  
make the text more readable.

### Kevin
> The website list feels "choppie". Kevin

This is due to the margins that have to be adjusted and there is no animation on the content block.

### Vincent
